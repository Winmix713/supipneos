/**
 * RELEASE A/C — PIPELINE CONTRACT GUARD.

 * would happily resume a checkpoint whose historical prefix was scored BEFORE
 * the new markets existed. The consequence is silent and severe: the
 * incremental tail would carry `secondary.homeOver05`, the reused prefix would
 * not, and the market-specific calibration would then be measured on a
 * truncated history.
 *
 * This version therefore stamps the whole PIPELINE OUTPUT contract — the score
 * matrix marginals, the `secondary` market block, the per-market evaluation
 * records and the checkpoint payload. Any change to what a completed walk
 * EMITS bumps this number and forces one full historical rebuild.
 *
 *   v1 — original pipeline.
 *   v2 — 20-dimensional feature vector, HT features, momentum, joint matrix,
 *        session checkpoint.
 *   v3 — RELEASE A: team-goal markets (`homeOver05` / `homeUnder05` /
 *        `awayOver05` / `awayUnder05`) on every `MatchPipeline.secondary`.
 *   v4 — RELEASE C: market-specific prequential calibration
 *        (`MARKET_EVAL_SPECS`, `MarketCalibrationBand`) accumulated during the
 *        walk and persisted on the checkpoint.
 *   v5 — GOAL-MARKET λ NORMALISER FIX: the venue defence rates in
 *        `forecastCore` were divided by the wrong league mean, biasing λ_home
 *        up and λ_away down and de-calibrating every market read off the joint
 *        score matrix (BTTS, O2.5, team-goal lines). Every stored `secondary`
 *        probability written before this build is unusable as an out-of-sample
 *        observation, so the market tallies must be re-measured from match one.
 *
 * Release A and Release C each require their own full rebuild. They ship in the
 * same build here, so the stamp lands on v4 directly: every checkpoint written
 * before this build (v1/v2, or unstamped) is discarded once and rebuilt from
 * match one, which is exactly the guarantee both releases demand. v5 forces the
 * same one-time discard for the λ fix.
 *   v6 — persist B1 λ values in every canonical `MatchPipeline`, so a
 *        versioned server run can faithfully reproduce score-market outputs.
